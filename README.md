# US Injuries Flood Prediction with Large Language Models Data Augmentation


Climate change poses significant risks to societies worldwide, particularly through extreme events and climate-related hazards. The importance of understanding both exposure and vulnerability move by integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) approaches with the goal towards targeted adaptive strategies.

The research has been focused on the flood event type from the US storm events database with data provided by the National Weather Service (NWS) and containing statistics on deaths, injuries and damage estimates.

By leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT engine) using Scikit-LLM library, the aim has been to retrieve features from narrative data related to climate events, and specifically, have been employed zero-shot text classification and embeddings techniques used as data augmentation.

To forecast injuries the performance of the Actuarial models like Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) have been compared with Gradient Boosting Machine Learning models like LightGBM, XGBoost, and CATBoost.
